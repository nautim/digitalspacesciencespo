## Introduction

In recent years, France has experienced a number of high-profile terrorist attacks, according to data from the Global Terrorism Database, between 1970 and 2020, there have been a total of 1228 terrorist attacks, resulting in over 1400 deaths and more than 4000 injuries. The deadliest attack in recent history occurred in November 2015, when a series of coordinated attacks by ISIS militants in Paris left 130 people dead and hundreds more injured (Abboud, 2022). Since then, France has experienced several other high-profile terrorist attacks, including the truck attack in Nice in July 2016, in which 86 people were killed and more than 400 injured (Rubin and Breeden, 2017), and the beheading of a schoolteacher in a Paris suburb in October 2020. The frequency and severity of these attacks have had a significant impact on French society. Additionally, they have led to increased scrutiny of online discourse related to extremism and terrorism, and have also sparked heated debates about immigration, national security, and the role of Islam in French society.
 
The relevance of these attacks for online discourse is increasingly important and lies in the fact that social media platforms, such as Twitter, have effectively become an arena for public discussion and debate. In the aftermath of terrorist attacks, social media can serve as a platform for people to express their opinions, share information, and engage in discussions with others. This can include expressions of support for victims, condemnation of the attackers, and debates about issues related to the attacks, such as immigration, religion, and national security.
 
Analyzing online communication related to terrorist attacks in France can therefore provide valuable insights into the nature and extent of extremist sentiment and activity online, as well as the ways in which information is disseminated, before and after the attacks. By examining the language and themes used in online discourse, we can gain a better understanding of how people make sense of these events and the impact they have on French society. Understanding the nature and extent of this online discourse is therefore crucial for gaining insights into the dynamics of extremism, polarization, and political debate in France.

## Research topic

Our research objective is to analyze online communication related to four chosen attacks in France. 

In particular, we set out to examine how online content – Twitter social media posts – related to the aforementioned attacks changes over time. To better understand how communication changes we set out to analyze tweets relating to both attacks carried out by right-wing extremists and Islamist extremists.

By analyzing online communication related to these attacks, we can gain insight into the nature and extent of extremist sentiment and activity online, as well as the ways in which information is disseminated before and after the attacks. We aim to identify patterns, themes, and sentiment in the online content through natural language processing, machine learning, and topic modeling. Additionally, the study also seeks to examine how the online discourse changed before and after the attacks and to examine whether partisanship or ideology differentiate the attacks if they allow for greater discourse change or discourse polarization.

## Context

The two right-wing extremist attacks under consideration are the Bayonne mosque shooting that took place on October 28th, 2019, and the 2022 Paris attack that occurred on December 23rd, 2022. The Bayonne mosque shooting was carried out by an 84-year-old retired French army officer who attempted to set fire to the mosque before shooting and injuring two men who tried to stop him. The attacker, who had a history of far-right views, was later arrested and charged with attempted murder, possession of weapons, and attempted arson (Chazan, 2019). The 2022 Paris attack was perpetrated by an individual believed to have links to far-right groups, who opened fire in a crowded shopping center, resulting in the deaths of six people, including three Kurds, and injuring several others. The perpetrator, who was identified as a 34-year-old French national, was later found dead at the scene (Henley, 2022).
 
The attacks claimed by the Islamic State that were selected for this study are the Nice stabbing that occurred on October 29th, 2020 and the Rambouillet attack that took place on April 23rd, 2021. The Nice stabbing was carried out by a Tunisian man who stabbed several people with a knife inside the Notre-Dame Basilica, resulting in the deaths of three people and several others being injured. The attacker, who had arrived in France a few weeks earlier, was arrested and charged with murder and attempted murder (Salaün and Pailliez, 2020). The Rambouillet attack was carried out by a Tunisian man who stabbed and killed a police officer in the entrance hall of a police station. The attacker, who had a history of psychiatric problems, was later shot dead by other police officers. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that the attacker was acting on their behalf (Breeden, 2021).

## Academic Background

The utilization of social media in the context of terrorist attacks has been explored through various themes in existing literature. Collective sense-making, as discussed in studies by Stieglitz et al. (2017), Heverin and Zach (2012), Mirbabaie and Zapatka (2017), and Fischer et al. (2016), focuses on the use of social media to make sense of events during and after a crisis, aiding individuals and communities in understanding and coping with the situation. Convergence behavior, a theme found in papers by Mirbabaie et al. (2017), Shaw et al. (2013), and Hughes et al. (2008), examines how individuals and groups come together on social media to share information, support each other, and coordinate response efforts during crisis situations.

Information dissemination and gathering play a crucial role in the spread of information during a crisis, as evidenced in the works of Akhgar et al. (2013), Simon et al. (2015), and Eriksson (2016). These studies highlight the sharing of eyewitness accounts, official updates, and news articles on social media platforms. Emotional support and expressions of grief, as explored in Stieglitz et al. (2017), Heverin and Zach (2012), and Eriksson (2016), discuss how social media is used for emotional exchanges, including sharing grief, shock, and solidarity during and after a crisis event.

The role of influential users in shaping the discourse and spreading information during crisis situations has been investigated by Mirbabaie et al. (2017) and Mirbabaie and Zapatka (2017). Having identified these main themes, our study seeks to build upon them by examining the dynamics of online communication surrounding terrorist attacks in France. In particular, we are interested in how discourse changes over time through the identification of patterns, themes, and sentiment in the content.
